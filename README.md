# MLfromscratch
This is my implementation of statistical learning methods in Python, and they are all written using jupyter notebook.
This work is inspired by the implementations from Patrick Loeber, https://github.com/python-engineer.

Advice: Use VSCode to edit them, with only couple of packages make things muuuuch easier for you!!

They include KNN, K-means, Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, PCA, SVM, Decision Tree and Random Forest. More methods will be implemented soon!!
